    <h1>Elephants: Gentle Giants</h1>
    <p> Despite being the largest land mammals, elephants are not ferocious nor beast-like. Actually, they epitomize the term "gentle giant" as they are intelligent and social creatures that occupy very similar traits to humans. Here is a link to an interesting elephant doing a well known human activity.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owSZs7H24UY">Painter</a> </p>
    <h2>Gentle</h2>
    <p> Elephants have an increased sensibility and an increased sense of family.  Female elephants tend to spend their entire lives in one herd and they tend to be extremely associated with others in the herd as if they are siblings, parents, and even grandparents. Here is a link to an example of the close-knit elephant social structure.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-GdNAnVweE">Fallen</a> </p>
    <h3>Giants</h3>
    <p> Despite their gentle nature, elephants are physically the largest land mammals. Even at birth, calves weigh between 200-250 pounds. Adult elephants weigh between 4,000 and 14,000 pounds. Females are slightly smaller weighing between 6,000-8,000 pounds. Here is an image that truly illustrates the magnificent stature of an elephant. <a href="img/animal-size-comparison-24.jpg">Giants</a> </p>

    <p>This website is simply a student trying to code a website of her choice for her web page development class; it is in no means credible to be used for any projects or papers about elephants. Thank you. However, still enjoy the funny videos of elephants being cute. </p>
