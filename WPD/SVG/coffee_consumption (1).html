        <p> <strong>A SVG is a scalable vector graphic; it can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. In this SVG, the symbol with the id of each country, country value, art (coffee cup and person), and heading is listed separately with all of the CSS applied to that id. However, another id of "infographic large" is created where groups of the initial ids are listed (bigger container); whenever the id is "infographic large," specific CSS for each element will appear. Ids of "infographic medium" and "infographic small" are created that act in the same way. In order to display CSS for "infographic large," the ids of "infographic small" and "infographic medium" must have a property of "display:none." Then, using @media, define what changes indicate a modification in the CSS.  In this case, when the screen reaches the max width of 500px, the CSS will change to the next rule. In the next rule, the id of "infographic large" has a property of "display:none", so it will not appear. Additionally, the id of "infographic medium" has a property of "display:block", so it will appear once the screen hits the max width of 500 px. Then, using @media, define what changes indicate a modification in the CSS again. In this case, when the screen reaches the max width of 400 px, the CSS will change to the next rule. In the next rule, the ids of "infographic large" and "infographic medium" have a property of "display:none," indicating that they will not appear. However, the id of "infographic small" has a property of "display:block," indicating that it will appear when the screen reaches a max width of 400 px.</strong>      </p>
